# Interacting Dark Energy Model with Trace-Free Einstein Equations Implementation in CLASS

This is a modified version of the [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) Boltzmann code implementing an interacting dark energy model with trace-free Einstein equations as described in:

## Modifications

The modifications to the original CLASS code are minimal and include:
- Modified files: `source/background.c` `include/background.h`
- Modified files: `source/perturbations.c` 
- Modified file: `source/input.c`
